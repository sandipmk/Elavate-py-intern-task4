## üìö Approach

1. Setup Flask App

   - Imported Flask, request, and jsonify.

   - Initialized Flask instance.

2. In-Memory Data Storage

   - Used a Python list of dictionaries to store users instead of a database.

3. CRUD Endpoints

  - GET: Fetch all or specific users using Python list filtering.

  - POST: Generate new id dynamically, append to list.

  - PUT: Find user by ID, update fields if provided.

  - DELETE: Remove user by filtering list.

4. Error Handling

  - Returned "User not found" with HTTP 404 when ID is missing.

  - Used proper HTTP status codes (201, 204, etc.).
